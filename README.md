RODProt
=======

An R Client for Interacting with Data Encoded in one of the [Open Data Protocols](http://www.dataprotocols.org/en/latest/)  Standards. This package currently supports working with [JSON Table Schemas](http://www.dataprotocols.org/en/latest/json-table-schema.html), but we plan to continue development to support many of the other protocols, as well.
